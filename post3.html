                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I’m Guillermo Gabriel T. Suyan, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve had a hard time dealing with negative thoughts. They would take over my mind, and my way of handling them was to escape, usually in ways that weren’t good for me. I knew deep down that running away from these thoughts wasn’t the best way to deal with them, but it was the only thing I knew how to do. Eventually, this started to mess with my physical health too, and I realized I needed to find a better way to deal with what was going on in my head.</p>
                <h2>Understanding and Dealing with Negative Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Negative thoughts can feel like a dark cloud hanging over everything, making life seem way more difficult than it really is. These thoughts often come in different forms, like always expecting the worst to happen, or thinking that one bad thing means everything will always go wrong. Sometimes, I’d see things as either all good or all bad, without recognizing that life has a lot of gray areas. Other times, I’d blame myself for things that weren’t even my fault.</P>
                <p>For a long time, I dealt with these thoughts by trying to avoid them. I’d distract myself, pushing them to the back of my mind, but that only worked for a little while. The thoughts would always come back, and they’d be even stronger. This avoidance didn’t just affect my mind—it started to take a toll on my body too. I’d feel tired all the time, get headaches, and just feel off in general. I realized that this wasn’t working and that I needed to face my thoughts instead of running from them.</p>
                <h2>Steps to Overcome Negative Thought Patterns</h2>
                <p>The first thing I did was try to pay attention to when these thoughts would show up and how they made me feel. I started keeping a journal where I’d write down what I was thinking whenever I got stuck in a negative loop. Doing this helped me see patterns in my thoughts that I hadn’t noticed before. Once I could see these patterns, I started questioning them. I’d ask myself if these thoughts were actually based on facts or if I was just assuming the worst. By doing this, I began to realize that most of my negative thoughts weren’t even true—they were just fears or old habits.</p>
                <p>Instead of letting these thoughts control me, I worked on changing how I thought about things. If I caught myself thinking something like, “I’ll never be good at this,” I’d try to flip it around and say, “I might not be great at this now, but I can get better with practice.” This wasn’t about pretending everything was perfect, but more about seeing things in a more balanced way. I also started practicing mindfulness, which basically means paying attention to what’s happening right now without judging it. This helped me stop reacting so quickly to my negative thoughts and made it easier to let them go.</p>
                <p>I also learned that it’s okay to ask for help. Talking to friends I trust and even seeing a therapist gave me new ways to look at things and made me feel less alone. On top of that, I started taking better care of my body, because I realized that how I feel physically can affect my mood. I began exercising more, eating better, and making sure I got enough sleep, which all helped reduce stress and improve how I felt overall.</p>
