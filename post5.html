                <h1>Very Mindful: A Demure Introduction to Grounding</h1>
                <p class="author">by Kiara Mariz B. Laxamana</p>

                <p>How often do you find yourself stressing about the future? For many of us, the answer is most of the time. With prices rampantly rising, our government stealing idling, and deadlines quickly approaching, it's difficult not to be overcome with these thoughts.</p>
                <p>Conversely, others find themselves trapped in reflections on the past, replaying moments and wondering what they could have done differently.</p>
                <p>This oscillation between the past and future creates a constant unease, where the present moment is often overlooked. We become trapped in a loop of regret and worry, unable to fully engage with the here and now.</p>
                <p>As a result, many of us find ourselves habitually reaching for our phones, seeking comfort in short-form videos and endless online stimuli. This relentless quest for distraction becomes a pattern, a way to escape the discomfort of the present.</p>
                <p>We immerse ourselves in fleeting moments of digital engagement, which, while momentarily satisfying, only perpetuate the cycle of avoidance and detachment. This often leads to a pervasive feeling of emptinessâ€”not demure!</p>
                <p>I also fell into this trap during the shift to online classes during the pandemic. With deadlines stretching until 11:59 PM and the absence of a physical classroom structure, the constant connectivity can make you feel like you're always " on," leaving no space to breathe. As an escape, I mindlessly scrolled and slept the days away until my Google Classroom dashboard flashed bright red, notifying me of my 38 missing assignments.</p>
                <p>I knew that I could not continue like this. Ironically, my TikTok algorithm, my source of distraction, became the gateway to a solution. It introduced me to grounding techniques, and now I am sharing them with you.</p>
                <h2>What is Grounding?</h2>
                <img src="assets/8.jfif" alt="[Post Title]" class="grounding">
                <p>Grounding techniques are simple practices designed to help you reconnect with the present moment and reduce feelings of anxiety or detachment. They involve using your senses to bring your awareness back to the here and now, helping you escape the distraction cycle and regain control over your environment.</p>
                <p>One technique that really helped me during that time was the 5-4-3-2-1 method. In this method, you say the names of five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste. </p>
                <p>Try it out yourself, and explore various techniques to find what works best for you to bring more mindfulness into your daily life.</p>
