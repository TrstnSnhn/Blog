                <p>Childhood, wherein we, as a kid, have endless ideas of things or interests that we thought of doing when we grow up.</p>
                <p>I personally thought of many things that I wanted to do growing up. May it be a ninja, a superhero, a race car driver, and so on. But as I understood things a bit more and turned into a teen, I figured that I wanted to be a chef. It gave me an interest, why not cook and make the food myself so that I don’t need to buy outside. And so, I’ve tried baking desserts and cooking several dishes before. I thought that it would be my career path as an adult, but as I grew older, some things changed. I lost my interest in cooking. I became dependent and careless with my actions, the things that I need to do, and with myself. I came to a phase where I lost the sense of purpose in what I was supposed to do. I felt that I became stagnant and not seeing any improvement with myself to the point that I became sleep deprived and gained some weight. I wanted to feel the joy and thrill of doing something and the feeling of achieving something for myself.</p>
                <p>That’s when I started to do home workouts where I watch fitness coaches online. I started to lessen my sugar consumption and avoid fatty foods as well. The first few weeks were tough. This is where my body starts to ache due to the workout and feeling lazy as days go by. I told myself that it would be a waste of time if I stopped. And so, I gave my best and did the necessary preparations that I need to consistently do it. I strived every day until I decided to go to a gym where I could maximize my workouts. I began to change my diet which helped me gain more muscle than just by working out. Not only did it help me physically, but also mentally. It made me more focused and disciplined in working out and in different kinds of tasks and activities. It helped me survive through tough times. Working out became a safety net that I needed whenever I felt down.</p>
                <p>Now, I like the course that I’m taking, and I’m back and never been better. You will come to a point where you’ll feel that there’s nothing you can do, whether or what situation it may be. Always remember, only you can change the outcome of your life, and it is not the end whenever life hits you hard. Find something that will empower you and will help give meaning to your life. My journey to becoming a better version of myself is an ongoing process and up until now I have still strived to achieve my goals and aspirations.</p>
